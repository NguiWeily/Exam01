Assignment name  : only_z
Expected files   : only_z.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that displays a 'z' character on the standard output.

Here's an example implementation of the `only_z` program in C:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    char z = 'z';
    write(1, &z, 1);
    return 0;
}
```

In this program, we use the `write` function from the `unistd.h` header to output the character 'z' to the standard output (file descriptor 1). The `write` function takes three arguments: the file descriptor to write to, a pointer to the buffer containing the data to write, and the number of bytes to write. In this case, we pass 1 as the number of bytes to write, indicating that we want to write only one character.

After writing the character 'z' to the standard output, the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

When you compile and run this program, it will display the character 'z' on the standard output.

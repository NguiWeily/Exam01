Write a function that swaps the contents of two integers the adresses of which
are passed as parameters.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void	ft_swap(int *a, int *b);

Here's an example implementation of the `ft_swap` function in C:

```c
void ft_swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
```

In this function, we use pointers to swap the contents of two integers. We start by declaring a temporary variable `temp` to hold the value of the first integer `*a`. Then, we assign the value of the second integer `*b` to the first integer `*a`. Finally, we assign the value of `temp` (which originally held the value of the first integer) to the second integer `*b`.

By using pointers and dereferencing them with `*`, we can directly modify the values at the memory addresses provided as parameters to the function, effectively swapping the contents of the two integers.

You can use this function to swap the values of two integers by passing their addresses as arguments to `ft_swap`.

Write a function that reverses (in-place) a string.

It must return its parameter.

Your function must be declared as follows:

char    *ft_strrev(char *str);

Here's an example implementation of the `ft_strrev` function in C:

```c
char *ft_strrev(char *str) {
    int len = 0;
    char *start = str;
    char *end = str;

    while (*end)
    {
        end++;
        len++;
    }

    end--;

    while (start < end)
    {
        char temp = *start;
        *start = *end;
        *end = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }

    return str;
}
```

In this implementation, we use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to traverse the string from both ends. We calculate the length of the string by iterating over it with the `end` pointer. Then, we decrement the `end` pointer to point to the last character of the string.

We then use a loop to swap characters between `start` and `end` pointers until they meet in the middle. This effectively reverses the string in-place. Finally, we return the modified string.

You can use this function to reverse a string by passing it as an argument and storing the returned value.

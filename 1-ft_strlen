Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Your function must be declared as follows:

int	ft_strlen(char *str);

Here's an example implementation of the `ft_strlen` function in C:

```c
int ft_strlen(char *str) {
    int length = 0;
    while (str[length] != '\0') {
        length++;
    }
    return length;
}
```

In this function, we initialize a variable `length` to 0 to keep track of the length of the string. We then iterate over each character in the string `str` until we reach the null character `'\0'`, indicating the end of the string. During each iteration, we increment the `length` variable by 1.

Finally, we return the value of `length`, which represents the length of the string.

You can use this function to determine the length of a string by passing the string as an argument to `ft_strlen`.
